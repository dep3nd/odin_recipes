    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Baked chicken schnitzel is a lighter twist on the classic fried favorite, offering the same crispy texture with less oil. 
        Tender chicken breasts are pounded thin, then coated in seasoned flour, dipped in beaten egg, and covered with a layer of golden breadcrumbs. 
    </p>
        <p>
        Instead of frying, the schnitzels are baked in a hot oven until crisp on the outside and juicy inside. 
        A light drizzle of olive oil helps them achieve a beautiful crunch without excess grease. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Served fresh from the oven with a squeeze of lemon and a side of salad, potatoes, or steamed vegetables, baked chicken schnitzel makes a delicious, 
        wholesome meal that is both satisfying and simple to prepare.</p>
