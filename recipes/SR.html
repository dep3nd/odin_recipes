    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Smoked ribs are a mouthwatering barbecue favorite known for their tender, fall-off-the-bone texture and deep, smoky flavor. 
        Prepared by slow-cooking pork ribs over low heat, they absorb the rich aroma of wood smoke—often from hickory, applewood, or 
        mesquite—while developing a caramelized crust on the outside. </p> 
        <p> the ribs are usually coated in a dry rub of spices like paprika, brown sugar, garlic, and pepper, creating a flavorful bark as they cook. After several hours of smoking, 
        they are brushed with a tangy barbecue sauce for a glossy finish. The result is a perfectly balanced dish that is smoky, sweet, and savory—a true celebration of slow-cooked comfort food.</p>
